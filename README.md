# Notion-Webhook
code to create a Notion webhook that will auto-create a OneNote file and store a link to it in a Notion database using the AMP (by CubeCoders) Python App Runner Instance

Goal For Project: Make a python script that will run a webhook that will receive information from a specific Notion event (addition of item to a database) and check if that creation of a new item is in a specific database, and if so, then a new OneNote file will be
created that has the name of the new item and a client link to this new OneNote file will be pasted on this new item in the database(s) of choice.

This is useful in very few situations but it is very helpful if you would like a script to auto-create new OneNote files and have them stored seamlessly in Notion (or seemingly that way)
